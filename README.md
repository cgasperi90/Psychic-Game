# Psychic-Game

The Psyschic Game is a fun and interactive game where the user tries to guess a random letter picked by the computer. The user has 9 tries to guess the correct letter before they lose the game. If the user gets all the 9 attempts incorrect, then the games counts it as a loss and the game resets. If the user guess the correct letter in less than 9 guesses, then the user gets a point and the game resets. Have fun Playing!
